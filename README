NAME
       Gorona - Coro based PSGI web server... for Gopher (with apologies to
       Miyagawa and his Corona)

SYNOPSIS
         gorona app.psgi

DESCRIPTION
       Gopher has long been the preferred hypertext protocol, offering rich
       media, metadata annotation, rich forms, accessibility, high
       performance, fantastic content, and a lack of utterly bullshit content
       such as <http://myspace.com>, but has thus far been lacking is a
       generic stack for mounting dynamic applications.  Enter Gorona, the
       first Rack inspired server for Gopher.

       Since Gopher is essentially a superset of HTML/HTTP except for the
       stupid parts, goronaiaing up your existing Web app should just work
       (note:  JavaScript support is not implemented at this time).

       Uses Coro::AIO (and IO::AIO) if available, to send the static
       filehandle using sendfile(2).

       Sets "psgi.multithread" env var on.
